scap-security-guide for Debian
-----------------------------

The OpenSCAP team has separated the SCAP implementation (OpenSCAP project)
and the Guides and benchmarks (SCAP-security-guide project), used by the
oscap binary to validate the local system.

This package suite deploy all guides and benchmarks that are not a
part of the openSCAP project directly (deployed through libopenscap8).
