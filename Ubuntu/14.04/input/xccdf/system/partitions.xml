<title>Hardening the filesystem</title>
<description>Hardening the filesystem and its usage is an efficient way to ensure an efficient separation of services,
data and configurations while ensuring a more precise management of filesystem level access rights, enabling deactivation
of some specific rights at the filesystem level. Moreover, the Linux Virtual file system support various hardening mechanisms
that can be set using sysctl.</description>

<title>Partitioning</title>
<description>
  Separating various locations of the file systems in different partitions allows a more restrictive
  segregation, distinctly from one location to another. Moreover, some native restrictions can be made by
partitioning, such as no hard link between different filesystems, and reduce the corruption impact to the
affected filesystem instead of the entire system. The last gain is to allow a differenciated usage of storage
media, depending on the operational needs (speed, resilience, etc.).
